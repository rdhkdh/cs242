## Question 1: Coin Change Problem
**Files used:** assignment4_q1.py  

**How to execute:**  
  
**Steps:**
1) Open the Linux terminal in the directory where the Python file is stored. 
2) Type the command and press Enter:   
``` python assignment4_q1.py``` 

**Explanation:**  
The solution is based on Dynamic Programming- which optimizes the program as a whole, rather than the Greedy algorithm approach, which only performs local optimization. In this approach, let S be the total sum for which change is needed. And let C be the last coin's denomination. Let F(S) represent the minimum number of coins needed to produce the sum S. Then we can use the recursion F(S)=F(S-C)+1 for analysis. We have to recursively minimze F(S-C) whenever S > C.   
The idea of the algorithm is to build the solution of the problem from top to bottom. It applies the idea described above. It use backtracking and cuts the partial solutions in the recursive tree, which don't lead to a viable solution. Ð¢his happens when we try to make a change of a coin with a value greater than the amount S. To improve time complexity we store the solutions of the already calculated subproblems in a table.  
lru_cache() helps in reducing the execution time of the function by using memoization technique. DFS is applied on each viable value of S, and those branches are cut off wherein S-C < 0.
> Note: The recursion stack has a capacity of maximum 10 recursive calls, therefore inputs < 475 are preferred. 

## Question 2: Latex script
**Files used:** assignment4_q2i.tex, assignment4_q2ii.tex  

**How to execute:**  
  
**Steps:**   
1) Open the LaTeX File in TexMaker. 
2) Then run the .tex file to obtained the rendered .pdf file.

### **Explanation:**  
i) LaTeX syntax is used to generate the PDF provided in the question. Inline math is written using single dollar signs. The word LaTeX is written in its trademark font. The 'equation' tag is used for giving a maths eqaution separate space. The 'align' environment is used when multiple labelled eqautions need to be aligned. Eqauation references 'eqref' can be used with the equation numbers. The 'matrix' environment is used for creating a matrix.  
ii)
